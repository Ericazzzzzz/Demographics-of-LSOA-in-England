### Demographic Data Analysis and Area Classification ([https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_link](https://github.com/Ericazzzzzz/Demographics-of-LSOA-in-England))

**Project Overview**:  
This project focuses on analyzing demographic data from the 2021 Census for England, using data science techniques to uncover insights about the population distribution by age and region.

**Key Steps**:
- **Data Processing**: Handled demographic data for over 33,000 LSOAs, calculating the proportions of younger and older residents in each area.
- **Visualization**: Created bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to visualize age distributions and regional variations.
- **Area Classification**: Developed rules to classify areas based on their proportions of younger and older populations, grouping LSOAs into categories such as 'workers' (low proportions of both young and old), 'retirement areas' (high proportion of older residents), and 'student areas' (high proportion of younger residents).
- **GeoPandas for Mapping**: Used GeoPandas to map the classified areas visually, highlighting the regions with unusual population distributions.

**Results**:
- Identified key patterns in population distribution that varied across urban and rural areas.
- Provided a classification system that can aid in demographic studies and urban planning.

**Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, GeoPandas.
