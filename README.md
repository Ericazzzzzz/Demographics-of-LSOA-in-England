# 📊 Demographic Data Analysis and Area Classification

**🔍 Project Overview**:  
This project focuses on analyzing demographic data from the 2021 Census for England, using data science techniques to uncover insights about population distribution by age and region.

**📌 Key Steps**:
- 🗂️ **Data Processing**: Managed and cleaned demographic data for over 33,000 LSOAs, calculating the proportions of younger and older residents in each area.
- 📊 **Visualization**: Designed and implemented **bar charts**, **histograms**, and **scatter plots** to visualize population age distributions and compare regional variations.
- 📑 **Area Classification**: Developed rules to classify areas based on population proportions, creating categories such as:
  - 👨‍💼 **Workers**: Low proportions of both young and elderly.
  - 🏡 **Retirement Areas**: High proportion of elderly residents.
  - 🎓 **Student Areas**: High proportion of younger residents.
- 🗺️ **GeoPandas for Mapping**: Utilized GeoPandas to visually map and highlight regions with unusual population distributions across England.

**🚀 Results**:
- Identified significant patterns in population distribution that varied across urban and rural areas.
- Created a classification system to help inform demographic research and urban planning initiatives.

**🛠️ Technologies**:  
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, GeoPandas
